      <ChallengeItem title="Financial Pressures:">
        Economic challenges, such as fluctuating commodity prices and high operational costs, can lead to financial strain, a primary concern affecting farmers' mental health.

      <ChallengeItem title="Weather Uncertainties:">
        Dependence on weather for crop and livestock health means that droughts, floods, or unseasonable conditions can devastate livelihoods, contributing to increased stress and anxiety.
      </ChallengeItem>
      <ChallengeItem title="Social Isolation:">
        Rural settings often result in physical and social isolation, limiting access to support networks and mental health resources, thereby exacerbating feelings of loneliness and distress.
